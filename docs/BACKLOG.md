The "Zero Effort" SaaS Options (Generous Free Tiers)
These are plug-and-play. You drop a <script> tag into your Firebase-hosted frontend, and the feedback goes to their dashboard.

Appzi: One of the most generous free tiers in 2026. It offers unlimited feedback and a simple widget builder. It’s perfect for small projects because it doesn't expire.

Sleekplan: Excellent if you want a "Changelog" or "Feature Request" board alongside your bug reports. Their free "Indie" plan covers basic feedback collection.

Hotjar (Basic): Best if you want to see context. It captures the user's feedback along with a recording of what they were doing on your site right before they clicked "report bug."
